# Super-Resolution-of-Human-Faces
Ascend 310 is an ASIC processor designed specifically for Computer Vision and Deep learning purposes. The smartphone industry is shifting towards ASIC chips
with advancements in Deep Learning and Computer vision techniques. Apple’s Bionic A13 chip is one such example capable of executing Deep Learning and Computer vision
algorithms at run time. Huawei’s Atlas 200 DK can inference input images at an astonishing speed and hence is used in real-time. In this project, we have ported the Fast
Super-Resolution CNN (FSRCNN) model to the DK and run it on the faces taken from the Face Detection model. One of the potential applications for this would be to deploy
FSRCNN on a smartphone and inference an input image with faces to scale in size with minimal data loss.
